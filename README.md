Programming 101 is a foundational course that introduces students to the basics of computer programming and computing systems. This course will cover a broad range of topics, including Boolean logic, binary representation, computing components such as the ALU, registers, RAM, CPU, operating systems, and computer networks.

The course will start by discussing logic gates and Boolean logic, which are the building blocks of modern computing systems. They will explore how computers represent letters, numbers, and other data using binary code. Additionally, students will learn about computing components such as the ALU, registers, and RAM, which are responsible for the calculations and storage of data in a computer.

Students will also learn the fundamentals of coding and programming concepts such as statements and functions. Students will learn how to write basic programs using different programming languages such as Python. The course will also cover the basics of algorithms and data structures, which are essential for building efficient and scalable programs.

We will cover the central processing unit (CPU) and its role in executing instructions, as well as the operating system, which provides a platform for running software programs. The course will also introduce the concepts of memory and storage, including different types of memory such as cache, virtual memory, and flash memory, and different types of storage devices such as hard drives, solid-state drives, and cloud storage.

Finally, the course will discuss computer networks, including the basics of network architecture, protocols, and services. Students will learn how computers communicate with each other over the internet, and how data is transmitted and received between different devices.

Overall, Programming 101 is an essential course for anyone interested in learning how computers and computing systems work. Students will develop a strong foundation in programming concepts, computing components, and network architecture, preparing them for further study in computer science or related fields.
